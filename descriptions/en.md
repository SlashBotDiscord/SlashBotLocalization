# SlashBot

SlashBot is a new innovative bot that brings slash commands and other new interactions to your server.
You can get started by inviting and typing out / and selecting the available commands.
SlashBot offers a wide variety of features. From simple moderation over fun commands to utility commands, role management commands, info commands and more.

## ButtonRoles

One of our key features are ButtonRoles.
With ButtonRoles you can easily let members of your server assign role(s) to them selves.

ButtonRoles have 4 modes:
- Toggle, which removes if you have the role and adds if you don't have the role
- Add, which only adds the role no matter if you have it already
- Remove, which only removes the role no matter if you don't have it
- Switch, which removes one role but adds another role in return

You can customize the label, emoji and even the style of the buttons.

Another key feature are DropdownRoles.
With DropdownRoles you can easily let members of your server select one or more of pre-defined roles.
